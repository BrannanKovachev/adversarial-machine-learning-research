# Adversarial-Methods
This is a repository for a summer of research I did regarding Adversarial Machine Learning. Other than learning and of course the code, the main outcome was the following poster which summarized the most important or notable things we learned or did.

The research was done in cooperation with Robert Hughes with advisement from Charles Flemming. However, the vast majority of what is present in this repositroy is my own  work.
